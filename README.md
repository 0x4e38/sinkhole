# The Memory Sinkhole
An x86 design flaw allowing ring -2 privilege escalation.

* sinkhole.asm contains the proof of concept apic overlay attack.
* Coming shortly:
  * Loadable kernel module for deploying ring -2 rootkit through the sinkhole
  * (Benign) SMM rootkit sample

(Currently need to finish the "benign" part)
